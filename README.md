# MakersBnB Project 

This is a group project created as part of our first engineering project on the Makers Bootcamp. 

The program uses Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL and RSpec for testing. 

The website allows users to sign up, sign in, search dates for a space, book a space for one night as a user, confirm or decline a booking as a host, and upload a new space.

## Setup

```bash
# Install gems
bundle install

# Run the tests
rspec

# Run the server (better to do this in a separate terminal).
rackup
```
